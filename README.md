Student project - Create simple application with database connection

Main functionality should be merged into develop branch.
Every feature added $Must$ be accepted by all team members

If you want to create a new feature there's a quick guide:
1. Create branch based of develop.
2. Add propper prefix e.g. improvement, hotfix, task, tryout then name of a task. It should look like this: ```improvement/update-readme```.
3. Make your changes.
4. Dont forget to commit them ðŸ˜‰
5. Create a Pull Request to develop.
6. Wait for a review. Be ready for corrections.
7. After approval merge a branch to develop and delete your branch.

Let's work together :)
